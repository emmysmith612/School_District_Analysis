# School_District_Analysis 
# Module 4 Challenge : PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of Project
For this project we were assisting Maria with compartmentalizing data on test scores for a city school district. This required us to examine the scores for both math & reading, for charter & public school students. 
### Purpose
The purpose for this was to provide infomation that would be utilized in strategic decisions involving the school district. 
## Outcome 
Academically, charter schools preformed much higher than public schools. This could be largely due to the fact that charter schools have a smaller number of students, potentially meaning they could have smaller class sizes. With smaller class sizes this could result in students getting more academic attention than their public school counterparts. It may beneficial to collect the student to teacher ratio for each of the schools to further expand on this theory. Additionally, the math scores between charter & public schools were considerably different with charter schools preforming much higher, however the reading scores were more on par with one another. To better undstand why this is the school district may want to research how the math & reading departments curriculum for public & charter schools differ from one another.
